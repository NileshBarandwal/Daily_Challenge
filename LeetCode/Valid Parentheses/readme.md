# Intuition
To determine if a string containing brackets is valid, the key is to ensure that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket and that they appear in the correct order. A stack is ideal for tracking open brackets and ensuring proper closing, as it follows a last-in, first-out (LIFO) structure. This allows you to match opening brackets with their corresponding closing brackets as they appear in the string.

# Approach
The approach involves using a stack to process the brackets in the string:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Create an empty stack to keep track of open brackets.
   - Define a map (`unordered_map`) that links each closing bracket to its corresponding opening bracket.

2. **Loop Through the String**:
   - Iterate through each character in the string.
   - If the character is an opening bracket (`(`, `{`, `[`), push it onto the stack.
   - If it's a closing bracket (`)`, `}`, `]`), check if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack does not match the expected opening bracket. If either condition is true, return `false` to indicate an invalid sequence.
   - If the stack matches the expected opening bracket, pop it from the stack to signify proper closure.

3. **Final Check**:
   - After processing the entire string, check if the stack is empty. If it is, all brackets were closed in the correct order, so return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

# Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this approach is $$O(n)$$, where $$n$$ is the length of the input string. Each character is processed once, and stack operations (push and pop) are constant time.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is $$O(n)$$, where $$n$$ is the maximum number of open brackets that could be on the stack at any time. In the worst case, all opening brackets are pushed onto the stack before encountering a closing bracket.

# Example with Detail Working
Consider the string `"{[()]}"`. Let's break down the steps to validate this string:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Stack: `[]`
   - Map: `{ ')' : '(', ']' : '[', '}' : '{' }`

2. **Loop Through the String**:
   - **Character `{`**: It is an opening bracket, so push it onto the stack.
     - Stack: `[{]`
   - **Character `[`**: It is an opening bracket, so push it onto the stack.
     - Stack: `[ { [ ]`
   - **Character `(`**: It is an opening bracket, so push it onto the stack.
     - Stack: `[ { [ ( ]`
   - **Character `)`**: It is a closing bracket. It matches the expected opening bracket at the top of the stack. Pop from the stack.
     - Stack: `[ { [ ]`
   - **Character `]`**: It is a closing bracket. It matches the expected opening bracket at the top of the stack. Pop from the stack.
     - Stack: `[ { ]`
   - **Character `}`**: It is a closing bracket. It matches the expected opening bracket at the top of the stack. Pop from the stack.
     - Stack: `[]`

3. **Final Check**:
   - Since the stack is empty, it indicates all brackets were closed properly. Thus, the result is `true`.

This example demonstrates how the stack-based approach correctly validates a string containing brackets.


# Code
```
class Solution {
public:
    bool isValid(string s) {
 // Initialize a stack to track open brackets
        stack<char> stack;
        // Mapping of closing brackets to their corresponding opening brackets
        unordered_map<char, char> matching = {
            {')', '('}, // Matches closing to opening brackets
            {']', '['},
            {'}', '{'}
        };

        // Loop through each character in the input string
        for (char c : s) {
            if (c == '(' || c == '{' || c == '[') {
                // If it's an opening bracket, push it onto the stack
                stack.push(c);
            } else {
                // If it's a closing bracket
                if (stack.empty() || stack.top() != matching[c]) {
                    // If the stack is empty or the top doesn't match the closing bracket, it's invalid
                    return false;
                }
                // Pop the matching opening bracket
                stack.pop();
            }
        }

        // The stack should be empty for a valid bracket sequence
        return stack.empty();
    }
};
```
