# Intuition
To solve this problem, we need to find a value \( x \) such that there are exactly \( x \) elements in the array that are greater than or equal to \( x \). Our approach will involve sorting the array and then iterating through possible values of \( x \), counting the number of elements greater than or equal to \( x \) for each \( x \).

# Approach
1. Sort the array to facilitate counting elements greater than or equal to \( x \).
2. Iterate through possible values of \( x \) from 0 to the length of the array.
3. Count the number of elements greater than or equal to \( x \) for each \( x \).
4. Check if the count matches \( x \). If it does, return \( x \). If no such \( x \) is found, return -1.

# Example with Detailed Explanation
Let's take the example input array `nums = [0, 4, 3, 0, 4]`:

1. **Sorting the Array**: After sorting, the array becomes `nums = [0, 0, 3, 4, 4]`.
2. **Iterating Through Possible Values of \( x \)**:
   - \( x = 0 \): All elements are greater than or equal to 0, count = 5.
   - \( x = 1 \): All elements are greater than or equal to 1, count = 5.
   - \( x = 2 \): There are 3 elements (3, 4, 4) greater than or equal to 2, count = 3.
   - \( x = 3 \): There are 3 elements (3, 4, 4) greater than or equal to 3, count = 3.
   - \( x = 4 \): There are 2 elements (4, 4) greater than or equal to 4, count = 2.
3. **Checking the Condition**:
   - For \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 1 \), the count does not match \( x \), so they are not valid.
   - For \( x = 2 \), the count matches \( x \), so \( x = 2 \) is valid. Return 2.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
  - \(O(nlogn)\) due to sorting, where \(n\) is the size of the input array.
- Space complexity:
  - \(O(1)\) since we use only a constant amount of extra space for variables.


# Code
```
class Solution {
public:
    int specialArray(vector<int>& nums) {
    sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    int n = nums.size();

    for (int x = 0; x <= n; ++x) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num >= x) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        if (count == x) {
            return x;
        }
    }
    return -1;

    }
};
